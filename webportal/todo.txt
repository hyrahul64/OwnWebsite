Day#1:
	- Created project with STS starter project (option selected - devtools, security, jpa, mysql, web).
	- Created first controller clas which server basic home page and about page.
	- Created home page with simple list base navigation bar on left.
	- Initialize git repo and going to push into my github account right after writing this.

TODO:
	- Extract stylesheet to another file and link to the home html page.
	- Remove spring secuirty feture from main (starting of webportal) page to only personal page.
	- Convert application to template like portal means upon navigation of different links on home page, only content should be chnaged and placed to right side part of webpage, so basic header & navigation list remains same while navigating through different part of website.
